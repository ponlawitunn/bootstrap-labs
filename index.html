                    Zoology is the study of animals. Currently there are over 66thousand (less than 5% of all animal)
                    vertebrate species, and over 1.3 million (over 95% of all animals) invertebrate species in existence.
                    Animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure,
                    embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct,
                    and how they interact with their ecosystems.

                        The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world.
                        A blue whale calf weighs two tons (1,814 kilograms) at birth and gains an extra 200 pounds (91 kilograms) each day of its first year.
                        Blue whales are able to breathe air, but they are very comfortable in the ocean waters where buoyancy helps to support their incredible bulk.
                        These mammals are found in all the world's oceans and often swim in small groups or alone.

                        Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances.
                        It usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however.
                        After a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat.
                        The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day.
                        The cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall.

                        Polar bears live along shores and on sea ice in the icy cold Arctic.
                        When sea ice forms over the ocean in cold weather, many polar bears, except pregnant females, head out onto the ice to hunt seals.
                        Polar bears primarily eat seals. Polar bears often rest silently at a seal's breathing hole in the ice, waiting for a seal in the water to surface.
                        A polar bear may also hunt by swimming beneath the ice.
